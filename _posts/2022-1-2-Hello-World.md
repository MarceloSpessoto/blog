title: A Hello world from kw blog
---

For a long time, I have been considering creating a blog for the kworflow
project where we can have posts that are not suitable to the standard
documentation. I had this desire because sometimes, when I was working on some
issues, I took some time to appraise some exciting topics related to Bash or
Linux kernel that was worth publicly sharing. However, I utterly want something
informal and with a low overhead to maintain. After asses my options, I decided
to use a straightforward Jekyll template with trivial automation associated
with the main branch.

Anyway, here we go! Our first blog post. See you soon.
